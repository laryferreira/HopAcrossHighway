### Tools and skills:

Through this quick project I was able to find out about [P5.js](https://p5js.org/)' online editor and to exercise my loops, lists and functions comprehension skills on a pratical (and fun) game, using recently learned JS commands. 

#### Hop Across Highway presents:
  - A system for counting points gained and lost.
  - Soundtrack and sound effects for better experience.
#### Can I play the game?
   Not yet! Since this game was developed only to practice Javascript skills, the lauch was not thought about. 

## Original game (Freeway - 1981):

I developed a game based on Freeway, released for the Atari 2600 in 1981. In the original version of the game, the player controlled a chicken so that it crossed a highway full of cars and trucks, with many tracks, without being hit.
